# 11 [DEDUCTION]
# Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world
echo 'Using the command, "traceroute slash16.org", I was able to deduce that the device named NAT (with an IP of 10.90.1.11) represents the device that makes the link between the local network and the outside world. 

The NAT converts the private IP addresses used in our network to a public one for use over the remainder of the route.'
