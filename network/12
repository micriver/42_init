# 12 [COMMAND] Find the IP that was assigned to you by dhcp server
host `hostname`

# DHCP is located in your Wifi/ADSL/GPON Router to facilitate addressing of connected devices. It also gives each host on the network a leased IP address, the subnet mask, and the gateway address.
# The host command is a DNS lookup utility and it can also be used to perform reverse lookups for local network troubleshooting.
